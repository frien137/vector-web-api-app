		<h1>Vector Web App Information</h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>Implementation:</h2>
		<p>The implementation of this web app needs a little bit of explanation since it is a little strange.<br><br>
		The original idea was to make an app that uses pure browser-side JS to communicate directly with the Vector HTTPS SDK interface. That would be the best way to do it.<br><br>
		However, somewhere early in the process I decided to change paths and make a whole new robot-side HTTP API (docs coming soon). This is so devices like ESPs, Raspberry Pis, etc can communicate with Vector directly without going through an authentication/GUID hurdle.<br><br>
		This API was made with golang and accepts HTTP POST requests. There is a helper bash script which uses CURL which is what actually commmunicates with Vector's HTTPS interface and the auth servers.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Known Issues:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Sometimes settings won't update, especially when Vector is sleeping due to lowered cpu freq</li>
			<li>The app is overall pretty slow due to how many steps it takes for each call.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Planned Features:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Say Text</li>
			<li>Meet Victor</li>
			<li>Remote Control</li>
			<li>Camera Feed (maybe)</li>
			<li>Snoring enable/disable</li>
			<li>CPU/RAM frequency setter</li>
			<li>Snowglobe enable/disable</li>
			<li>Boot slot (a/b) selector</li>
			<li>Soundbank selection (could put in noises from 1.0, 1.1, 1.6, etc)
			<li>Option to downgrade to 1.6</li>
		</ul>
